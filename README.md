# Vimes2 - Virtual Machines Experimentation Sandbox 2

Another take on my [Vimes project](https://github.com/mobarski/vimes).

**Vimes** is a collection of virtual machines (VMs) and related resources for studying their performance, ease of  implementation, and ease of use. This sandbox includes a variety of VMs  with different architectures, dispatch techniques and implementations as well as benchmarks and utilities to help measure and  compare their characteristics.

**Warning**: this is experimental / pre-alpha code.



## Key Takeaways

**Development:**

- VM instruction sets are easy to implement, as each instruction is relatively simple.
- The biggest investments (so far) when creating a new VM are:

  - Transforming assembly into machine code.
  - Loading machine code into the VM.
  - Creating a buffered reader and an int parser for stdin.
  - Creating CLI.
  - Creating tests and benchmarks.
- The ability to define aliases for values (like `n=1`) and mnemonics (like `peek=lpa`) is a huge step forward in assembly UX with very little changes in the assembler (1 token is still 1 token).
- The ability to define multi-token aliases facilitates keeping the instruction set orthogonal (ie you can quickly add stacks with `peek`, `poke`, `inc`, `dec` and they can either grow up or down).
- Having all 3 conditional jumps related to comparison (<0, >0, ==0) makes the code much easier to write and read.
- Having array like access (ptr+offset) vs just pointers is a huge step forward in the assembly UX.

**Performance:**

- üî• [benchmarking results](benchmark.md) üî•

- Wirth's machine is 2-3 times slower than register machines without stack frames.

- C enables more performant dispatch techniques, such as indirect and direct threading.

- Indirect and direct threading are twice as fast as switch-based dispatch.

- Indirect threading seems to be the best approach when writing a VM in C (10% slower but no code remapping).

- The performance of C programs compiled with Zig is similar to that of programs compiled with gcc (¬±20%).

- Nim's {.computedGoto.} pragma resulted in 10% slower code.

- Translation of machine code into C results in **extremely** fast execution but the return from the procedure call is a bit tricky.

- Zig acting as a C compiler outshines gcc in optimization of the translated machine code.

  

## VM versions

## VM registers / variable names

### mk1 - mk5

These machines use the same variable names as Wirth's example p-code machine from 1976 (available [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-code_machine#Example_machine)).

- **p** - program register

- **b** - base register

- **t** - topstack register

- **s** - stack

- **i** - instruction register

- **a** - argument register

- **l** - level register

- **code** - program memory

  

## VM instructions

### mk1 - mk5

Basic instructions:

```
- LIT a   ; load constant (a)
- INT a   ; increment t-register by (a)
- LOD a b ; load variable (a) from level (b)
- STO a b ; store variable (a) at level (b)
- CAL a b ; call procedute (a) at level (b)
- JMP a   ; jump to (a)
- JPC a   ; jump conditional to (a)
- OPR a   ; execute operation (a) ie OPR ADD
- EX1 a   ; execute operation (a) from VM extension 1
- EX2 a   ; execute operation (a) from VM extension 2
- EX3 a   ; execute operation (a) from VM extension 3
  ...
- HLT     ; halt the program
```

**operations:**

```
- ADD ; (ab--c)  c = a + b
- SUB ; (ab--c)  c = a - b
- MUL ; (ab--c)  c = a * b
- DIV ; (ab--c)  c = 
- RET ; (ab--c)  c = 
- NEG ; (a--b)   b = -a
- ODD ; (a--b)   b = a % 2
- MOD ; (ab--c)  c = a % b
- EQ  ; (ab--c)  c = 1 if a==b else 0
- NE  ; (ab--c)  c = 1 if a!=b else 0
- LT  ; (ab--c)  c = 1 if a<b  else 0
- LE  ; (ab--c)  c = 1 if a<=b else 0
- GT  ; (ab--c)  c = 1 if a>b  else 0
- GE  ; (ab--c)  c = 1 if a>=b else 0
```

The notation `(ab--c)` describes the stack effect of an operation. It indicates that the  operation expects two items to be on the stack before execution,  referred to as `a` and `b`, and after the operation is executed, these items are replaced by a single item `c` on the stack. The items before `--` are consumed (popped) from the stack, and the items after `--` are produced (pushed) onto the stack.



Extension 1 - stdio:

- `PUTC`, `PUTI`
- `GETC`, `GETI`
- `EOF`

Extension 2 - ALU extension (bit ops):

- `AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, `NOT`
- `SHL`, `SHR`, `SAR`

Extension 3 - ALU extension (common ops)

- `INC`, `DEC`
- `EQZ`, `NEZ`, `LTZ`, `LEZ`, `GTZ`, `GEZ`
